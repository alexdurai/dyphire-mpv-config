# Only select forced subtitles that are explicitly stated in the subtitles track.
# By default, when searching for subtitle tracks in a specific language,
# Force subtitles to be included in search results the same as other tracks.
# This means there is no way to write a rule that specifically excludes forced subtitle tracks
# By enabling forced subtitles, forced subtitles will never be selected unless a rule explicitly contains "forced" in `slang`

##⇘⇘Basic Instructions:
## If a "#" exists at the beginning of a line, this option is disabled (i.e., restored to MPV's default settings). Delete it to enable.
## Some enabled parameters have no "=", meaning the item is actually "yes". For example, deband is disabled by default: --deband is equivalent to --deband=yes; similarly --deband=no is equivalent to commenting out the parameter.

vo=gpu-next                           # <gpu/gpu-next/libmpv> Video output driver. Many subsequent options only work properly under these three options. Current version default is gpu-next.
                                      ## gpu has the highest universality and completion; gpu-next see discussion here https://github.com/hooke007/MPV_lazy/discussions/39; libmpv is for some frontend designs, generally not used.
                                      ## gpu-next has better prospects, currently implemented Dolby Vision RPU layer metadata parsing mapping, but does not yet support EL layer metadata parsing.
                                      ## Specific differences between gpu-next and gpu see official wiki related documentation: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/GPU-Next-vs-GPU
gpu-api=vulkan                         # <opengl/vulkan/d3d11> [Recommended d3d11 when using SVP frame interpolation] Choose graphics rendering interface.
                                      ## opengl is the least recommended choice. Windows' native rendering is d3d11 (mpv's default for Windows, graphics card note to enable adaptive power mode).
                                      ## Through d3d11-adapter you can specify which graphics card mpv uses. See documentation: https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-d3d11-adapt
                                      ### How to choose gpu-api?
                                      ## Linux/macOS: vulkan or opengl, vulkan recommended.
                                      ## Windows: vulkan, d3d11 and opengl are all optional. Recommended to use native d3d11 API for best performance and implemented 10-bit output.
#gpu-context=auto                     # <win/dxinterop/angle/d3d11/winvk/macvk> Choose output backend. This option is usually automatically determined by --gpu-api=<value>; when --gpu-api=opengl defaults to angle, it's better to change to win/dxinterop.
#fbo-format=auto                      # Internal processing precision. This option is usually automatically determined by --gpu-api=<value>, default prefers 16-bit or higher precision. This parameter cannot be modified under --vo=gpu-next.
#d3d11-exclusive-fs=yes               # Full-screen exclusive mode under --gpu-api=d3d11.
#d3d11-flip=no                        # [Usually occurs when --d3d11-exclusive-fs=yes and --on-top are used together] Can be used to avoid MPV full-screen freezing.
                                      # If the above problem exists, enable this parameter, otherwise it should not be used because the flip model in d3d11 has the best performance. Testing shows that N-card drivers have performance limitations in flip mode; when encountering rendering bottlenecks, disabling is recommended.
                                      # [When --gpu-context=angle also has full-screen freezing] Use parameter --angle-flip=no instead of d3d11-flip=no.
#d3d11va-zero-copy=yes                # [When gpu-api=d3d11] By default, when using hardware decoding with --gpu-api=d3d11, video images will be copied (GPU to GPU) from the decoder surface to shader resources.
                                      # Setting this option avoids copying by directly sampling from decoder images. This can improve performance and reduce power consumption, but may cause incorrect image sampling at bottom and right edges due to padding, and may trigger driver errors because Direct3D 11 technically doesn't allow sampling from decoder surfaces (though most drivers support it).
                                      # When decoding stutters or drops frames, enabling this option may help improve.
hwdec=vulkan                       # Specify the hardware video decoding API to use. Change to "no" for software decoding. Hardware decoding on Windows is recommended to use d3d11va or d3d12va-copy. d3d11va has the best hardware decoding support, providing 4k60fps native hardware acceleration for av1 format and 8k.
                                      # --hwdec=auto-safe is equivalent to --hwdec=yes. When --gpu-api=d3d11, value auto prefers d3d11va; when --gpu-api=vulkan, value auto prefers nvdec. auto-copy prefers d3d11va-copy.
                                      # Not recommended to use the theoretically highest decoding efficiency native hardware decoding without -copy, the purpose is to ensure all settings/filters/shaders work properly (some don't support). Note that nvdec hardware decoding without -copy does not support d3d11, only vulkan and opengl.
                                      ## You can also use a priority list composed of multiple values, for example value vulkan-copy,nvdec-copy,auto means trying these decoding modes in sequence.
                                      ## When using auto without specifying a specific hardware decoding API, it's recommended to use the auto-safe parameter, which will prioritize hardware decoding APIs actively supported by developers (d3d11va or nvdec on Windows).
                                      ## Hardware decoding may encounter some problems. It's recommended to prioritize software decoding (official manual doesn't recommend using hardware decoding).
                                      ## Testing has found that copy hardware decoding mode under --vo=gpu with 4K or higher video frame rate >= 60fps will produce abnormal frame drops. It's recommended to use software decoding mode or non-copy hardware decoding mode.
hwdec-codecs=all                     # Try hardware decoding within the selected range of encoding formats. Current version default is --hwdec-codecs="h264,vc1,hevc,vp8,vp9,av1,prores".

hwdec-image-format=nv12               # Specify the pixel format used for hardware decoding. Default is auto, which automatically selects the best format based on the decoder and GPU capabilities.# AMD supports nv12 well
                                      # You can manually specify a format like nv12, p010le, yuv420p10le, etc. Note that not all formats are supported by all decoders and GPUs.
#hwdec-threads=0                      # Specify the number of threads to use for hardware decoding (default: 4). If set to 0, the number of available CPU cores will be determined automatically.
#vd-lavc-dr=no                        # [When gpu-api=d3d11] Enable direct rendering (default: auto). If set to yes, video will be decoded directly to GPU video memory (or staging buffer).
                                      # If set to no, video will be decoded to system memory, then copied to GPU memory. This may cause performance degradation but may solve problems on some low-end intel GPUs.
                                      # Default auto will automatically choose based on decoder and GPU capabilities (automatically disable for low-end intel GPU devices).
#vd-queue-enable=yes                  # Enable video decoder queue (default: no). If set to yes, the video decoder will run on a separate thread, which may cause performance degradation but may solve problems on some low-end intel GPUs.
#vd-lavc-threads=8                    # Number of threads for decoding. Whether threading is actually supported depends on the codec (default: 0). 0 means auto-detect the number of cores on the machine and use it, maximum 16. You can manually set more than 16 threads.
#vd-lavc-assume-old-x264=yes          # Assume video is encoded by old, buggy x264 versions (default: no). Only try enabling this if x264 yuv444p10 format video has decoding errors to solve ffmpeg compatibility with old x264 encoding.
#opengl-pbo=yes                       # Enable PBO. On some drivers, this may be faster, especially if the source video is large (e.g., so-called "4K" video). On other drivers, it may be slower or cause latency issues.

### Video-related settings use configuration groups for setting. Below are just parameter examples for explanation. See [Common Parameters Supplement Area] and [Configuration Groups] sections for actual settings.

##⇘⇘Below are ICC color management related parameter settings.
#icc-profile="~~/icc/ITU-RBT709ReferenceDisplay.icc" 
                                      # Load ICC profile and use it to convert video RGB to screen output. Choose ICC profile corresponding to your display's color gamut. This option overrides --target-prim, --target-trc and --icc-profile-auto options.
                                      ## Since mpv color calibration target is bt.1886 (approximately gamma=2.4), when enabling --icc-profile-auto using system default (srgb) calibration file, the (srgb) calibration file's transfer curve usually is srgb, causing abnormal mpv image display.
                                      ## For the above problem, best to manually specify gamma curve as gamma2.4 corresponding monitor color gamut calibration file. Example parameters can be referenced.
#icc-profile-auto                     # Can enable if professionally calibrated (system directory contains corresponding icm calibration file). If not calibrated, wide color gamut screens should manually specify target-prim=<value>.
                                      # Enabling color management allows standard color space video to display relatively correct colors on wide color gamut monitors, disabling restores over-saturated state.
                                      # Currently mpv using icc color management because calibration curve target is bt.1886, causes some display screens to have color cast and dark image issues https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8009
                                      ## Enabling parameter --icc-force-contrast=1000 can solve issues where some calibration files have extremely high contrast causing dark images (OLED screens test reasonable values yourself). #! Note this still can't solve HDR mapping dark image issue.
                                      # Or use --target-prim=<value> parameter to manage color space.
#icc-intent=0                         # ICC color transformation mapping intent. 0: perceptual, 1: relative colorimetric (default), 2: saturation, 3: absolute colorimetric. Recommend using perceptual mapping  https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8009#issuecomment-923607273
#icc-force-contrast=1000              # <no|0-1000000|inf> Color management. Override static contrast data in ICC file. Default no doesn't override. OLED can be set to inf meaning unlimited (if this data is missing in ICC auto fallback to 1000). This only affects bt.1886 content display.
                                      ## Normal LCD generally use 1000 (based on panel native data); OLED display device users try using 1000000 or special value inf. LCD set to 1000 can solve issue where some calibration files have extremely high contrast causing blacks to be too dark.
                                      #! This parameter won't take effect under --vo=gpu-next, default using contrast data marked in ICC file, missing defaults to 1000.
#icc-3dlut-size=64x64x64              # <default auto|RxGxB> Size of 3D LUT generated from each dimension of ICC profile. Range <2--512>.
#icc-cache=no                         # Whether to store ICC profile 3dlut cache locally. Default enabled.
#icc-cache-dir="~~/cache/icc_cache"   # Specify directory to store and load 3D LUT created from ICC profiles. This can speed up loading. Note these files contain uncompressed LUT. Their size depends on --icc-3dlut-size and may be very large. Note: doesn't auto-cleanup, so old unused cache files may stay indefinitely.
                                      ## Generating 3dlut cache should speed up, but insufficient hard disk IO performance may have opposite effect. Choose whether to disable based on actual situation.
#use-embedded-icc-profile=no          # Load embedded ICC profile contained in media files (like PNG images). (Default: yes). Note this option under --vo=gpu only takes effect when simultaneously using display ICC profile (--icc-profile or --icc-profile-auto).

##⇘⇘Below are target color management related parameter settings.
#target-prim=auto                     # Wide color gamut screens should set this parameter to specific value to solve over-saturated color issue. When not using ICC color management, video colors adapt to this color space. srgb screens don't need changing this default (bt.709). Other examples: 99% argb screens write adobe, 90%+ p3 color gamut screens write dci-p3 or display-p3.
                                      # Using --target-prim=<value> parameter for color space management causes color cast in HDR. Setting --gamut-mapping-mode=clip during HDR mapping can solve this https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/9071
                                      #! Note: After Win11 24H2 version, if system's HDR or ACM (automatic color management) is enabled, don't change this item, otherwise will cause color gamut recompression limiting causing color desaturation.
#target-gamut=dci-p3                  # Explicitly limit display's color gamut. You can use this option to limit output color gamut, like DCIP3-in-BT.2020; set `--target-prim` to color space specification and set `--target-gamut` to output color gamut to limit. Depends on `--target-prim`. (Only applies to `--vo=gpu-next`).
                                      #! Note: After Win11 24H2 version, if system's HDR or ACM (automatic color management) is enabled, don't change this item, otherwise will cause color gamut recompression limiting causing color desaturation.
#target-trc=gamma2.2                  # Specify display's transfer characteristic (gamma). Takes effect when not using icc color management. Default auto: under --vo=gpu use gamma2.2 in HDR, no processing in SDR; under --vo=gpu-next always use bt.1886 curve (assumes infinite contrast, i.e., OLED).
                                      # For non-OLED and non-HDR displays, always recommend using gamma2.2 curve to avoid mpv image being too dark. HDR direct output requires using auto or pq value.
#target-contrast=auto                 # <auto|10-1000000|inf> Specify measured contrast of output display. Combined with --target-peak for calculating display black point, used for HDR tone mapping black point compensation.
                                      # Default is auto, assumes 1000:1 contrast (considered typical SDR display). When direct HDR, will have infinite contrast. inf contrast specifies display capability with perfect black level, i.e., OLED display.
#target-peak=auto                     # <auto|nits> Specify measured peak brightness of output display. Affected by --target-trc parameter. Default auto: use appropriate value based on trc parameter, default 203 for SDR, for HDR recommend specifying specific nits based on actual display effect.
                                      # When using icc color management, if nits set higher than default (203), display will be treated as HDR screen by mpv.
                                      #! Note: If system's HDR display mode is enabled, this option must be set to 203 for SDR content, otherwise will cause serious image darkness. For HDR content need to use auto or peak brightness value.
#sdr-adjust-gamma=yes                 # <default auto|yes|no> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next]. Control whether SDR content should adjust its gamma value. Only applies to sRGB output target configuration because this is most common and unambiguous case.
                                      ## no: content marked as sRGB, gamma2.2 or bt.1886 transfer characteristic renders as-is; yes: convert based on available metadata; auto: behaves like no, unless --target-trc is explicitly set, then behaves like yes.
                                      ## If you can ensure both source and target metadata are correct, usually recommend enabling this option for more accurate display effect.
                                      ## Additionally, bt.1886 requires known display contrast to render correctly.
#treat-srgb-as-power22=no             # <no|input|output|both|default auto> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next]. When enabled, use gamma2.2 curve instead of standard sRGB transfer function.
                                      ## no: no special treatment; input: before converting input to target color space, treat sRGB as gamma 2.2 processing; output: after converting colors to output color space, treat sRGB as gamma 2.2 processing;
                                      ## both: apply both input and output modes; auto: similar to both, may adjust for platform to ensure appearance stability. System compositor may use different sRGB EOTF depending on platform.
##⇘⇘Below are 3dlut related parameters.
#lut=<file>                           # [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], Specify custom LUT (Adobe .cube format) to apply as part of color conversion. Exact method depends on --lut-type.
#lut-type=conversion                  # [Takes effect when --lut=<file> is enabled], <default auto|native|normalized|conversion>, Control how color values enter and exit LUT specified by --lut.
                                      # auto: auto select LUT from marked metadata, otherwise fallback to system (default); native: apply to original image content in native RGB color space before conversion to output color space (non-linear light).
                                      # normalized: apply to normalized RGB image content under linear light before conversion to output color space.
                                      # conversion: fully replace conversion from image color space to output color space. If such LUT exists, it has highest priority and overrides any ICC profile and options related to tone mapping and output chromaticity (--target-prim, --target-trc, etc.).
#target-lut=<file>                    # [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], Specify custom LUT file (Adobe .cube format) to apply to colors before displaying on screen.
                                      # This LUT provides values in normalized RGB form after encoding to target color space, so processes after parameter --target-trc.
#image-lut=<file>                     # [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], Specify custom LUT file (Adobe .cube format) to apply to colors during image decoding. Exact method of LUT depends on --image-lut-type.
#image-lut-type=conversion            # [Takes effect when --image-lut=<file> is enabled], <default auto|native|normalized|conversion>, Control how color values enter and exit LUT specified by --image-lut.
                                      # auto: auto select LUT from marked metadata, otherwise fallback to system (default); native: apply to original image content in original color space before decoding to RGB. For example for HDR10 images, this inputs PQ-encoded YCbCr values with range 0.0-1.0.
                                      # normalized: apply to normalized RGB image content after decoding from native color encoding but before linearization.
                                      # conversion: fully replace color decoding. This type of LUT should ingest image's native color space and output normalized non-linear RGB.
##⇘⇘Below are hdr related parameters.
#inverse-tone-mapping=yes             # <yes|default no> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], If set, allow inverse tone mapping (extend SDR to HDR). Only valid on HDR devices. Doesn't support some tone mapping curves, use with caution.
target-colorspace-hint=auto            # <default auto|yes|no> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], If possible, auto configure monitor output color space to pass through media stream input values (can be used for HDR direct output or set SDR content output color space). Requires driver support.
                                      ## auto: only set target color space when current display parameters are known. Currently Wayland, D3D11 and winvk support this; yes: always set target color space; no: don't use target color space transmission.
                                      ## Windows needs manual switching monitor HDR mode (Windows limitation) to achieve HDR direct output.
#target-colorspace-hint-mode=target   # <default target|source|source-dynamic> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], Specify how to handle target color space transmission.
                                      ## target: use metadata based on actual display capabilities, fallback to source when target metadata missing. This is more reliable mode.
                                      ## source: use source content metadata. This is traditional HDR direct output mode, assumes compositor and display handle color space directly and perform necessary mapping. Not recommended.
                                      ## source-dynamic: same as 'source' but use dynamic per-scene metadata instead of static HDR10. This is experimental, depends on display's ability to react to metadata changes. Note this doesn't send complete HDR10+ or Dolby Vision metadata, but use them to generate dynamic per-scene HDR10 metadata.
#target-colorspace-hint-strict=no     # <no|default yes> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next], When enabled (default), respect configured swap chain color gamut (including hint). In this mode, `--target-*` options only serve as hint, negotiated swap chain format used for rendering output. When disabled, swap chain color gamut override to match `--target-*` options.
#tone-mapping=hable                   # Tone mapping algorithm. Other recommended usable ones are clip|mobius|reinhard|hable|bt.2390|gamma|spline|bt.2446a|st2094-10|st2094-40. Default auto, selects best curve by internal heuristics (actual spline under --vo=gpu-next).

                                      ## When vo=gpu, recommend testing hable or bt.2390. hable relatively preserves more detail, bt.2390 has better contrast.
                                      ## When vo=gpu-next, currently recommend testing spline, hable and bt.2446a. spline mapping algorithm combined with --hdr-compute-peak has best tone mapping performance inside current mpv.
#tone-mapping-param=0.3               # Small parameter for tone mapping algorithm. hable and bt.2446a have no parameter; bt.2390 has no parameter under --vo=gpu but default 1.0 under -vo=gpu-next; st2094-10 default 0.7/mobius and spline default 0.5/reinhard default 0.5/gamma default 1.8 (under --vo=gpu-next default 0.3).
                                      # When using bt.2390 under -vo=gpu-next, recommend values: 2.0 or 0.5 from ITU-R specification.
#tone-mapping-max-boost=1.0           # <1.0-10.0> Maximum exposure multiplier of average brightness. Default: 1.0. Increasing this value shows hidden details in dark areas, too high makes dark areas look unnaturally bright. Can try performance under 1.0,1.33. Only available under --vo=gpu.
#gamut-mapping-mode=clip              # <default auto|clip|perceptual|relative|saturation|absolute|linear|warn|desaturate|darken> After completing any tone mapping, specify how target display color gamut should be handled. Default auto: auto select best mode (actually applies perceptual).
                                      # clip: hard clip each RGB channel to target color gamut, recommend using first; perceptual: perform perceptual balanced color gamut mapping with soft knee, falloff clipping region function, and hue transformation, keeping saturation.
                                      # relative: perform relative colorimetric clipping while preserving brightness and chroma exponential relationship; saturation: perform simple RGB->RGB saturation mapping. Never clips, but distorts all hues and/or causes faded appearance.
                                      # absolute: perform absolute colorimetric clipping. Like 'relative' but doesn't adapt white point; linear: linearly/uniformly reduce image saturation so entire image stays in target color gamut.

#hdr-reference-white=100              # <auto|10-1000000> [Takes effect when --vo=gpu-next] Specify HDR diffuse reference white luminance for SDR content in cd/m² (nits). Essentially this is SDR brightness in HDR container. Default 203 cd/m².
                                      ## When output target transfer function is SDR, this option overrides --target-peak option value if set (if set). This means SDR and HDR output can be separately controlled.
#hdr-contrast-recovery=0.30           # <0.0-2.0> Enable HDR contrast recovery algorithm designed to enhance contrast of HDR video after tone mapping. Only applies to --vo=gpu-next.
                                      # Intensity (default: 0.0) represents degree of contrast recovery. 0.0 completely disables, 1.0 is 100% intensity. Values greater than 1.0 allowed but may cause over-sharpening.

#hdr-contrast-smoothness=3.5          # <1.0-100.0> Enable HDR contrast smoothness algorithm designed to enhance smoothness of HDR video after tone mapping. Only applies to --vo=gpu-next.
                                      # Smoothness (default: 3.5) represents HDR source low-pass degree for contrast information, value 2.0 corresponds to 2x downsampling. Users with low DPI displays (<= 100) may want lower this value, while very high DPI display (""Retina"") users may want increase.
#hdr-compute-peak=yes                 # <default auto|yes|no> This option basically provides dynamic scene-based tone mapping (older GPUs don't support this parameter, image will become washed out). May cause brightness to change when scenes change causing flicker.
                                      # Currently enabling --hdr-compute-peak with some tone mapping curves (bt.2390, reinhard) easily loses highlights detail or overexposure; some tone mapping curves show obvious improvement (spline, bt.2446a, hable).

#hdr-peak-percentile=100              # [Takes effect when --hdr-compute-peak=yes and -vo=gpu-next]. (<0.0-100.0> default: 100.0) Specify which percentile of input image brightness histogram to consider as true peak.
                                      # If set to 100 (default), measure brightest pixel. Otherwise, top distribution gradually cuts off. Setting too low causes clipping very bright detail but can improve dynamic range for scenes with very bright isolated highlights. Values outside 100 have slight performance loss.
                                      ## If image brightness constantly jumps, can lower this parameter to ignore some peak values. Not recommended below 99.7.
                                      ## Default hdr-peak-percentile value in mpv built-in gpu-hq config group is 99.995.
#allow-delayed-peak-detect=no         # [Takes effect when --hdr-compute-peak=yes and -vo=gpu-next]. Default no. When using --hdr-compute-peak, allow detected peak delayed one frame if beneficial for performance.
                                      # Especially when advanced rendering isn't needed, this avoids unnecessary FBO processing. Note -vo=gpu defaults to delaying peak processing.

#deband-iterations=1                  # <0-16> Deband execution times. Higher values give more strength but also more time and effort consumed. Values > 4 actually invalid (default 1). 3-4 equivalent to madvr deband set to high effect.
#deband-threshold=48                  # <0-4096> Filter cutoff threshold. Higher numbers increase strength but gradually reduce image detail (default 48).
#deband-range=16                      # <1-64> Initial radius. Larger values stronger deband and higher performance consumption; smaller values smoother (default 16). If increasing --deband-iterations, need to reduce this to compensate.
